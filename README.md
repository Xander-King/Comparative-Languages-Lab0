# Lab 0 - Setup

This just makes sure you can run programs written in a variety of languages using my docker image. 

# Testing Your Code

First, [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system.

Then fork https://gitlab.csi.miamioh.edu/CSE465/instructor/lab0.git into the group created for you at https://gitlab.csi.miamioh.edu/CSE465/yourid. 

Then, in a terminal, type
```bash
docker run -it femianjc/cse465
git clone https://gitlab.csi.miamioh.edu/CSE465/yourid/lab0.git
cd lab0
make check
```
